# safarinn

This project was bootstrapped using **React + Vite**.

It provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and ESLint rules.

## Features
- React with Fast Refresh
- Vite for super-fast dev and build
- ESLint preconfigured
- Supports Babel, SWC, or OXC via Vite plugins

## React Compiler
The React Compiler is disabled in this template for performance reasons.  
To enable it, see the official documentation:  
https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation

## TypeScript (Optional)
If you want to use TypeScript with type-aware ESLint rules, check the official TS template:
